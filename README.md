# Customer-Segmentation-Prediction-Python-ML-
Machine learning project to classify customers into meaningful categories using Logistic Regression, with insights derived from a Kaggle dataset.
#  Customer Segmentation & Prediction (Logistic Regression)

##  Objective
To classify customers into meaningful categories based on their behavior and attributes, enabling better decision-making for marketing, retention, and personalization.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Dataset
Customer behavioral dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.  
(Author unknown — used for learning and analysis purposes only)

---

##  Project Workflow
1. Data Import & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection & Encoding  
4. Train-Test Split  
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression)  
6. Evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)  

---

##  Key Insights
- Customer attributes strongly correlate with category/segment
- Logistic Regression was able to classify customers with good accuracy
- The model helps identify **high-value vs low-value customers**

---

##  Model Results
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **Output:** Predicted customer category  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
